Financial risk management provides a structured framework to measure, analyze, and control uncertainty in investments.
It begins with understanding returns, then advances to portfolio construction, assessing diversification, volatility, and optimal allocation.
Factor models, such as CAPM and Famaâ€“French, explain performance through systematic risk drivers.
Risk is quantified using VaR, CVaR, and stress testing, with all variables clearly defined.
Practical implementation is supported by Python, using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Statsmodels for real world analysis.
